# HWL Engine
Simple and inefficient Ray Casting Engine written in C using Allegro 5 Library, designed to run a simple horror-like game. Made as a school project.
I think the end result turned out pretty cool, considering how busy we were with other school stuff and what little time we've had.

I'm planning to release a stripped version of the game on IndieDB. I'm afraid I won't be able to upload all of the original maps. 
I have some concerns about copyrights and more so, the possibility of copyright infringement on maps that I didn't make. 

Feel free to do whatever you want to do with this.
